Smart::Comments version 0.0.2

Smart comments provide an easy way to insert debugging and tracking code
into a program. They can report the value of a variable, track the
progress of a loop, and verify that particular assertions are true.

Best of all, when you're finished debugging, you don't have to remove them.
Simply commenting out the C<use Smart::Comments> line turns them back into
regular comments.
